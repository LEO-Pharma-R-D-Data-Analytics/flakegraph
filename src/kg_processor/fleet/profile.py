"""The processing profile the fleet's workers actually run.

A worker claims only a run whose semantic configuration hashes to its own, so
a submit host that composes runs from any other profile asks the operator to
reconcile two configurations by hand - and learns of the mismatch only when a
run sits queued with nothing on the page to explain it. The profile is read
from what the worker pools mount, which is the one place it cannot drift.
