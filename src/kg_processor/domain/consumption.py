Consumption is recorded per graph so spend can be attributed to the work that
caused it, rather than inferred afterwards from a provider's invoice. Local runs
are recorded on the same terms as hosted ones: a local model bills nothing, but
the tokens it consumed are what make the avoided cost measurable, and a run whose
usage went unrecorded cannot be compared against anything.

Cost is derived here rather than stored by the adapters. Prices change, and a
recorded price becomes wrong silently; recorded *usage* stays true, so the rate
table can be corrected and every historical graph reprices correctly.
