"""Canonical document models shared by every OCR and file-source provider.

Provider adapters are intentionally forced to normalize into these shapes before
the graph pipeline sees anything. That keeps MinerU, Cortex, Tesseract, and
future OCR services replaceable without creating provider-specific branches in
chunking, extraction, or writers.
