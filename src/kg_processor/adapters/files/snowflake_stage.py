"""Snowflake stage file source.

The adapter lists stage contents but still exposes the same `InputFile` contract
as local/manifest sources so the pipeline does not need Snowflake-specific file
logic.

Snowflake reports its own MD5 for staged files. Every other source records a
SHA-256 of the bytes, so adopting the provider value would give one document two
identities depending on which runtime ingested it, and would silently fail any
comparison that binds a document by checksum. The bytes are therefore read once
to produce the same content hash as everywhere else, while the provider value is
retained separately as provenance.
