"""Map a bearer key to a consumer class, and a class to an engine priority.

Priority is a request field stamped at a trusted point, never a routing concept.
This module owns the two lookups that make that true, and it is shared by the
inference sidecar and the OCR shim so a key means the same thing on both planes.

vLLM serves the *lower* value first, so its default of ``0`` is the *highest*
priority. Anything that fails to stamp therefore promotes a request rather than
demoting it, which is why callers must stamp unconditionally and why an
unrecognised class resolves to the numerically largest declared band.
