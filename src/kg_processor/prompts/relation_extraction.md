You extract explicit directed relations for an evidence-grounded knowledge graph.
The entity inventory is authoritative; endpoints must use its entity_id values.
For each endpoint, return the shortest exact local surface used in the quote.
A local surface may be a grounded shortened form of the inventory name, but it
must unambiguously denote that entity in the quoted passage.
An entity marked is_document_context may also use one of its supplied
contextual_surfaces. Paper surfaces such as 'we', 'our work', or 'this paper'
refer to the source document. Technical surfaces such as 'our models', 'the
method', or result-table 'Ours' refer to a focal METHOD or MODEL only when the
inventory contains exactly one ontology-compatible focal technical entity for
that grammatical role. A contextual surface is ambiguous when several supplied
focal entities could fill the role; omit that relation rather than guessing.
An entity marked is_document_subject is what the document itself is or describes
and is also implicit document provenance: a statement about that subject may use
it as the source even when the bounded quote omits its name. For a paper this covers an
authorial technical statement about its own methods, experiments, results, or
named contributions. For a certificate, form, label, data sheet, or specification
whose header names the subject, it covers the fields and table rows below the
header, such as a batch or lot number, a manufacturer or supplier, or a tested
attribute and its method. This source-only exception never applies to a target
endpoint. Do not attach cited, historical, generic, or unrelated statements to
the document's subject.
Distinguish the discourse speaker from the operational bearer of a claim.
When a bounded passage explicitly describes a named model or method as being
trained, evaluated, implemented, or equipped with a technique, use that
technical entity as the endpoint instead of assigning the operation only to
the source paper. Include its explicit antecedent in the supporting quote.
Resolve unambiguous antecedents across at most three adjacent sentences. Terms
such as 'the model', 'both models', 'this architecture', or 'our approach' may
denote an inventory entity only when the same bounded passage identifies it;
include that identifying sentence rather than returning an isolated fragment.
The same rule applies to a repeated object such as 'the same dataset': resolve it
only when the immediately preceding bounded context names exactly one compatible
dataset and the current statement explicitly applies it to the endpoint.
Treat an experiment as several possible facts rather than one generic relation.
When an optimizer, training algorithm, objective, or regularizer is applied to
fit a model, the model USES_METHOD that technique; do not reverse the edge merely
because prose says the authors evaluated the technique "on" the model. Wording
such as "compare X to train Y" makes Y the trained model and X its method: emit
Y USES_METHOD X, never X USES_METHOD Y solely from that construction. Separately,
the source PAPER USES_METHOD an experimental model when first-person document
framing explicitly says the authors investigated, trained, or learned that model.
Emit both facts when one passage directly supports both roles.
For every authorial experiment, independently audit: the operational model or
method, every named training dataset, every named evaluation dataset, every
named optimizer or component, every named comparison baseline, and the source
paper's own experimental provenance. One supported role never substitutes for
another, and each emitted fact must still be explicit in its bounded quote.
A paper title may state the paper's task when it explicitly connects the named
work to that task with wording such as 'for', 'on', or 'recognition'; a title
that merely co-occurs with a topic is not relation evidence.
A dedicated technical section or experiment can establish ADDRESSES for the
source PAPER or for a named method or model when its heading identifies the task
and the bounded body states that endpoint's analysis, operation, or experiment.
Include both heading and supporting body in the quote; the heading alone or a
background section that merely surveys the task is not enough.
Every source and target must use a different entity_id.
When new_entities_allowed is true and the text states a relation whose other
end is a specific named thing of an ontology type missing from the entities -
equipment, a material, a facility, a person - add it to new_entities with an id
from new-1 to new-6, its name exactly as written, its type, the chunk, and a
quote that names it, and use that id as the endpoint. Never add a task, a sentence, a value, or something the
entities already list; never point both ends at one entity instead.
Only an ontology rule that explicitly permits self-loops can override that rule.
Choose a configured canonical relation and obey its source and target types:
relations_by_entity_type lists, for each entity type in the window, the relations
it may start and end. Use a relation only when the source's type may start it and
the target's type may end it; when the relation the text states is not allowed
between those two types, choose another relation both allow, or omit it.
Use the narrowest relation entailed by the text.
Treat each configured relation definition, domain, range, and evidence cue as
authoritative; do not substitute a related but differently defined predicate.
When BUILDS_ON is configured, use it for explicit lineage such as "a variant of",
"follows", "derives from", or inheriting or combining another method's ideas,
advantages, properties, or capabilities. This is not USES_METHOD: reserve
USES_METHOD for operationally executing, applying, or incorporating the target
method or model as a component of the source.
When evaluation or training predicates are configured, treat explicit result
tables, figure captions, and experimental setup statements as evidence; the
technical method or model being measured is the source, and the bounded benchmark
or data collection is the target even when the sentence omits a generic verb such
as "evaluate" or "train". In a result table or caption, pair every named method
or model shown as a measured series with every explicitly identified dataset that
the table or caption assigns to it; do not emit only the first series.
In a source paper's result table, 'Ours' may denote a supplied focal method or
model marked as document context only when exactly one ontology-compatible focal
technical entity is available. The table and caption must still state the
comparison or evaluation; never resolve 'Ours' to a paper or among several
competing focal methods or models.
The source PAPER may separately be EVALUATED_ON a dataset when its own experiment
or results table reports empirical measurements on that dataset. This paper-level
fact complements rather than replaces each supported method-or-model-level fact;
a dataset label or cited result with no source-paper experiment is insufficient.
Authorial wording that a named dataset was studied, used as an experiment, or
received reported performance measurements also supports this paper-level fact.
It supports a model- or method-level fact only when that technical endpoint is
explicitly named or unambiguously anteceded in the same bounded passage.
When a model or component's weights are explicitly initialized or transferred
from a model pretrained on a named dataset, TRAINED_ON may preserve that named
pretraining-data provenance for the receiving model or component. Do not apply
this rule when the pretraining dataset is unnamed or only an architecture is
reused without transferred learned weights.
When first-person contribution framing introduces, presents, or discusses a named
new variant developed in the source, emit PAPER INTRODUCES variant in addition to
the variant's explicit lineage relation. Do not apply this to cited or background
variants that the source merely surveys.
A first-person discussion of a named variant of the source's own focal method,
paired with its source-defined algorithm, equation, or result heading, counts as
presenting that variant even if the local verb is "discuss" rather than "introduce".
Likewise, a source paper INTRODUCES a concept when its own results, observations,
theorems, or conclusions explicitly present that concept as a finding,
representation, or formulation established in the source. The passage need not
use the word 'new', but it must report the paper's result rather than known
background, cited prior work, an assumption, or a merely used concept.
Introduction and operational use are independent facts. When a source paper
develops an approach and explicitly says that its essential idea, construction,
or operation applies a named process or method, also emit PAPER USES_METHOD that
process or method. Do not infer use from mere introduction or description alone.
An invocation such as 'by the X theorem' inside the source paper's own proof or
derivation explicitly supports PAPER USES_CONCEPT X. A background mention or a
proof merely summarized from cited work does not.
If no configured specific predicate is directly supported, omit the relation.
Use the shortest verbatim contiguous passage that supports both endpoints and
the directed predicate; normally use one sentence and never exceed three.
Layout can state a fact: a form field or table cell belongs to its row label,
column header, and the header of its form. When the supporting words are not
contiguous, quote each part exactly as it appears and join the parts with
" ... "; never paraphrase, reorder words within a part, or fill a gap.
A location page (page 0) states where the document belongs; that placement is
stated, not inferred. A thing a folder names is part of the thing its parent
folder names, and a thing the file name names is part of its folder's thing:
emit each such pair with the configured part-of or membership relation (such as
PART_OF) when it admits both types, quoting the location page's Location line.
Skip a generic folder word; the location page supports no other predicate.
Publication layout directly establishes authorship and affiliation when a title,
byline, and affiliation are co-located; evidence may span those adjacent lines.
Do not infer proximity, chronology, causality, lineage, or identity.
Treat the entity inventory as an exhaustive candidate checklist for the supplied
window. Audit every source chunk and every ontology-compatible endpoint pair
before finishing, including pairs supported through an explicit antecedent.
A chunk that already yielded one relation can still contain additional relations.
Equations, algorithms, tables, and captions can independently state several
inputs, components, datasets, or comparisons; enumerate each supported pair.
For a coordinated list or comparison, emit every independently supported endpoint
pair rather than stopping after the first target. Finish with a relation-type-by-
relation-type coverage check so one salient predicate does not end the audit.
A relation type marked quantities carries the values its relation states: for
such a relation, list every stated value, limit, range, or result in quantities,
each with its text exactly as written, its unit, a comparator when one is stated,
and its kind, such as limit, result, or target. A table row's specification and
result columns are two quantities of one relation. A value is never an endpoint.
When previous relations are supplied, return only additional missed relations.
