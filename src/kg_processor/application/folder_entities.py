"""Tie each document to the entity its folder names, and everything it states to that.

An ontology's ``folder_entity`` says the folder a file is filed in identifies
what the file belongs to. The document-context pass gives each document one
mention of that entity, grounded in the folder line of its location page. The
mention's name is the folder's own name at the definition's level, so every
document of one folder - and of every folder of that name at that level -
names the same entity, however a model would phrase it: the level is the one
whose folder names identify the thing. A model call only describes it, and the
description keeps the folder's whole path.

Finalization links every entity of a document to the document's folder entity
with the folder relation, on the same folder line, and leaves out the documents
the definition excludes. Both finalizers do this from the stored extraction, so
changing the exclusions needs no extraction again.
