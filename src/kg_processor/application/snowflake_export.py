"""Materialize a Snowflake-resident graph as local inspection artifacts.

Snowflake runs write the graph straight into ``KG_*`` tables, while every
inspection and evaluation tool reads the local parquet snapshot. Without a
bridge, a graph built on Snowflake cannot be compared against a gold fixture or
against a local run, which makes benchmark parity unverifiable on the one
runtime where the pipeline is most likely to be operated.

The export deliberately reads tables rather than reconstructing domain objects.
The Snowflake schema is generated from the same field definitions the artifact
writer uses, so column names already line up, and a row-level copy keeps the
export correct as the graph model evolves.
