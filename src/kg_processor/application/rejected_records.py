"""List every entity and relation validation turned away, and why.

Both engines derive these rows from the extraction trace, as they do the
discarded windows: the local pipeline from its in-process trace, the Spark
finalizer from its trace column. The summary names the relation type rules the
model broke most, so an ontology's author can see which rules cost true facts.

A relation held for type resolution leaves its record here too, so it is not
lost if finalization does not admit it; finalization takes back the records of
the relations it admits, and what remains is what stayed rejected.
