"""Record what every LLM call consumed, without touching the call sites.

Metering belongs at the provider boundary rather than in extraction, resolution
and enrichment separately: every one of those paths ends in the same three
methods, and instrumenting each caller would leave whichever path is added next
silently unmetered.

The wrapper is placed *outside* the enrichment cache, so a cached response — which
called nobody — records nothing.

A call that fails after exhausting its repair budget was still billed for every
attempt. Providers carry that usage on the failure, and it is recorded before the
failure is re-raised, so an expensive window is never reported as free.
