"""Five documents filed in folders read at level 2, ready for finalization.

Two documents sit in folders named "Northwind Pricing Study", one below a
picked root and one below an archive, and the model names that folder two
ways; two sit in "Contract ACME-0042", one of them under a location written
with an empty folder; one sits directly in the picked root and so under no
folder at that level. Each states products and the organization that makes
them; one names an organization no relation reaches. Local and Spark
finalization read the same shards.
